		"Notes"	"added '!reloadarmor' for admins/server ops to reload armor configs in a lazy way :), default flag is config"
		"Notes" "added special Armor classes so players can have armor that blocks only certain types of damage"
		"Notes" "Added Luck & Chance armor."
		"Notes" "the new armor classes are Kevlar (blocks bullets + non-explosive/fire projectiles), Blast (for explosives), and Asbestos Armor (for fire-based weapons) but they are in alpha stage and glitchy; best not to use until fixed"
		"Notes" "Added cvar that allows the HUD to be powered by a 0.2 second timer or using SDKHooks PreThink which updates every client frame"
		"Notes" "Seriously fixed the medic healing giving armor glitch."
